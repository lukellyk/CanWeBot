## DEPRECATED - Updates to the Discord API have made this bot no longer functional, maybe I'll get around to updating it some day

# CanWeBot
The _official_ bot of the DesComp students of The University of Sydney :trollface:

## Setup for developing
**Step 1:** Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

**Step 2:** Open a terminal in the **root directory** and run `npm run go`

**Step 3:** Retrieve token (for Discord and DagPi) from me (Luke) and paste into .env file

**Step 4:** Make sure no one else is running the bot (it will be offline in the test server)

**Step 4:** Run `npm start` (for MacOS and Linux) or `npm run start:windows` (for Windows) in terminal

**Step 5:** 'Develop' to your hearts content
